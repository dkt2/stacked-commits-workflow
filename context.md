# Stacked Commits Workflow

This is an example of an adapted stacked commits workflow for people not familiar with stacked-commits. The typical stacked-commits workflow requires a huge change to how most developers work, but the main benefits of a stacked-commits workflow can be obtained without having to change everything.
